        Hello there! I'm currently a student at California State University -
        Sacramento, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. I'm set to graduate
        after the fall 2024 semester, and I couldn't be more excited about it!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        My journey into computer science began with my passion for video games.
        Initially drawn to game development, I found myself increasingly
        fascinated by web development and software engineering. It's incredible
        how this field offers endless possibilities for creativity and
        problem-solving.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        When it comes to personality, I'd describe myself as outgoing,
        energetic, and perhaps a bit of a jokester. I believe in lifting others
        up and lending a helping hand whenever needed. Though I can be a bit
        stubborn at times, it's only because I value logical thinking and
        realistic perspectives. My drive to learn and grow, especially in the
        ever-evolving realm of computer science, keeps me motivated each day.
      </p>
      <br />

        Outside of academics, you'll often find me engaging in various physical
        activities like tennis or hitting the gym. I'm also a coffee enthusiast
        with my own dedicated station at home. Video games are another one of my
        passions, and I love spending time building things, whether it's
        websites, software, or DIY projects around the house.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        As I look towards the future, I'm eagerly anticipating what the tech
        world has in store. The possibilities seem endless, and I can't wait to
        be a part of it all!
